# MDST-GNN
 a multivariate time series deep spatiotemporal forecasting model with graph neural network (MDST-GNN) is proposed to solve the existing shortcomings and improve the accuracy of periodic data prediction in this paper.
 
 This is a PyTorch implementation of the paper: Multivariate Time Series Deep Spatiotemporal Forecasting with Graph Neural Network, published in Applied Sciences.

#Requirements
The model is implemented using Python with dependencies specified in requirements.txt
