# MDST-GNN
 a multivariate time series deep spatiotemporal forecasting model with graph neural network (MDST-GNN) is proposed to solve the existing shortcomings and improve the accuracy of periodic data prediction in this paper.
 
 This is a PyTorch implementation of the paper: [Multivariate Time Series Deep Spatiotemporal Forecasting with Graph Neural Network](https://doi.org/10.3390/app12115731), published in Applied Sciences.
